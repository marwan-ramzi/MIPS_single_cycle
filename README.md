# MIPS_single_cycle
Single cycle MIPS processor based on Harvard architecture using Verilog HDL. The implementation consists of 4 main blocks: Data Path, Control Unit, Instruction Memory, Data Memory. 
The simulation was performed on Modelsim using the following three programs written in machine code following MIPS ISA: GCD of 120 and 180, Factorial Number of 7 and The Fibonacci series numbers
